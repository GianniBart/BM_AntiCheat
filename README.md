### Features

AntiCheat detects some cheats, including:
- Kicking from illegal vents
- Illegal sabotage (except lights)
- Teleportation (may cause false positives with unstable networks)
- Movement during meetings (ClooseMeeting Cheat)
- Closing illegal doors
- Using illegal vents
- Tasks completed with cheats

Pressing F11 opens a mini-menu where you can choose whether to allow, kick, or ban suspected cheaters.
It only works if you are a Host and is incompatible with extra role mods (which would cause too many false positives).

AntiCheat detects hacks, but does not block them.

### INSTALLATION

To install the mod, just extract and copy the contents into the main folder of among.
(There are several tutorials online, if you encounter problems do not hesitate to contact me.)
The mod will create a new folder called BAN_DATA,

from there you can add names and banned words template, add/remove players from the ban list, ecc
